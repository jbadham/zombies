Zombies vs Humans ABM teaching model

The world is conceptualised as a city, with streets laid out on a grid. Humans run away from zombies and zombies walk toward humans. Fights occur between humans and zombies wherever both types of agents share a patch (or street intersection). A winning human kills a zombie (and increases their chance of winning their next fight), and a losing human becomes a zombie.

The model was originally published at: Badham JM & Osborn J-A (2015), Zombies in the city: A NetLogo model, in R Smith? (ed) _Mathematical Modelling of Zombies_, University of Ottawa Press. Supplementary materials (plots laid out to show the effect of changes in specific variables) are at: http://research.criticalconnections.com.au/zombies/zombies.htm
